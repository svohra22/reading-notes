#### What is a shell?
- part of the OS that defines ***how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.*** 
- most common shell available: ***bash***

ls = list


    
***Absolute vs Relative Paths***

Absolute path
- specifies location (file or directory) in relation to the ***root directory*** 
- you can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash (/)

Relative path
- specifies location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. ***They will *not* begin with a slash.*** 

root directory 
- top of the hierarchical structure 
- denoted by a single slash (/) 
    - has subdirectories and so on; files may reside in any of these directories
