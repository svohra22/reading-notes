I learned about how _basic syntax works - from the Markdown guide_
  - When you create a heading, include a space after the hashtag/number sign 
  - Put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility 
  - To write paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text
## Example (wrong way)

  While writing a paragrpah, I realized how different the HTML (raw) version is compared to the Markdown version. As you read this, you will realize there is no space. This makes the paragraph difficult to read and creates an unorganized clutter.
